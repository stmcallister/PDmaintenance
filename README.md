# PagerDuty Service Maintenance

This is a simple tool that showcases how to use [PKCE OAuth](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/oauth-2-functionality-pkce) and the [PDJS](https://github.com/PagerDuty/pdjs) library to enable and disable services in [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).

A detailed explanation of the PKCE OAuth code can be found in the [pagerduty-bulk-user-mgr-sample](https://github.com/PagerDuty/pagerduty-bulk-user-mgr-sample#pkce-oauth-sample) project. Questions about the code in this project can either be posted as an Issue in GitHub, or on the [Developer Forum](https://community.pagerduty.com/c/dev/7) on the [PagerDuty Community](https://community.pagerduty.com/) site.
